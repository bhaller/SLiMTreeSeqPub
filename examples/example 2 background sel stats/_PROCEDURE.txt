Background selection / "dip in diversity"
Status: finished


PROCEDURE FOR RUNNING EXAMPLE 2:

cd into the "example 2 simple neutral" directory

time ../slim -t -m -s 0 "./ex2_TS.slim"



RESULTS:

ex2_TS.slim took 275m42.822s user + 4m35.326s system == 16818.15 seconds, 2532.19MB peak memory



ANALYSIS:

we want to measure the tree height at each base position, to see the effect of the background selection from the central area
msprime docs: https://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html

so in Python I think we want to:

make a TreeSequence object
call trees() to get a tree iterator
iterate over the trees (SparseTree)
for each tree note its positional start and end (.interval) and its height (.time() of .root()?) â€“ multiple roots, it turns out
then just plot mean height against position

python ../msp-tree-heights.py --basedir . --tree_file ex2_TS.trees --logfile ex2_TS_heights.csv

(0m9.596s + 0m0.240s)

then use ./plot_heights.R to make the plot

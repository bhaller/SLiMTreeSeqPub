PROCEDURE FOR RUNNING EXAMPLE 2:

cd into the "example 2 simple neutral" directory

time ../slim -t -m -s 0 "./ex2_noTS.slim"

time ../slim -t -m -s 0 "./ex2_TS.slim"

time python ../msp-add-mutation.py --basedir . --tree_file ex2_TS.trees --mut_rate 0.9999e-7


add the user and system times to get total time spent



RESULTS:

ex2_noTS.slim took 4m18.445s user + 0m1.100s system == 259.545 seconds, 389.93MB peak memory

ex2_TS.slim took 0m4.363s user + 0m0.454s system == 4.817 seconds, 118.352MB peak memory

msp-add-mutation.py took 0m0.502s + 0m0.122s == 0.624 seconds

the two tree_seq steps together took 4.817 + 0.624 == 5.441 seconds


the treeseq method took (5.441 / 259.545) * 100 == 2.10% of the time that the non-treeseq method took

the treeseq method took (118.352 / 389.93) * 100 == 30.35% of the peak memory usage that the non-treeseq method took





the msp-add-mutation.py script presently overwrites any existing mutations with the added mutations; we want to add them, how do we do that?
dump the mutations table, somehow merge the old and new tables (?), somehow sort the result, give it back to msprime

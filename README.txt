This repository is for work on a paper about tree-sequence recording in SLiM

./outline has outline drafts
./paper has paper drafts
./examples has the examples we're using

Within ./examples, there is a copy of the slim executable that I used to run the examples; that will only run on macOS, of course

Each example folder has a file named _PROCEDURE.txt that spells out how to execute the example yourself

Enjoy!

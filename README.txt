This repository is for work on a paper about tree-sequence recording in SLiM

./examples has the examples we're using

Each example folder has a file named README.txt that gives a few details and sample results.

The .gitignore file for this repo prevents .trees, .slimout, .csv, .log, etc. files from being committed, so you can run the examples directly in their directories to generate all those files, without git getting confused.

Enjoy!
